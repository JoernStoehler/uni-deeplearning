    "In this exercise, you will code a regression model from scratch, to predict housing prices in California. \n",

    "Each record in the data (x) is comprised of 9 fields which include the size of the apartment in $m^2$, number of rooms, the location, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is split into a training and test set. There are 8 features for one data entry (8 columns for one row) and the targets (labels) are the median values of the houses at a location in $k$.\n",

    "$f_w (x) = w_1 x_1 + ... + w_{8} x_{8} + b$ \n",

    "Steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Implement a function to compute the loss: loss = (prediction - y)$^2$. Note that this function should calculate the average loss over all training samples. In short: implement a function which calculates the MSE-loss.\n",
    "2. Plot the predictions over the ground truth using `matplotlib`. Label the x and y axis appropriately and show the individual points **without** connecting them with lines.\n",
    "3. Implement the body functions of the `__init__` and `forward` methods of `LinearRegressor` to hold the model parameters w and b (both initialised using a normal distribution) and implement its correct linear regression equation function. Instantiate your module and show its trainable parameters to verify that w and b are within them.\n",
    "4.  Implement the body of the following function to perform one training step, given a torch module (which contains the variables of your model), the training data and labels, as well as the optimizer. Use your MSEloss function to compute the loss and back-propagate the gradients using `.backward()`. Update the model weights using `optimizer.step()`. Remember to reset the gradients before the step.\n",
    "5. Implement the body of the function for training and evaluating given a number of training steps. After every 1000 training steps the function should optionally (i.e., controlled via the `verbose` flag) output the loss on the training set, as well as the test set. The function should return the test set loss on the **last** step.\n",
    "6. Instantiate your model again and wrap it in a suitable stochastic gradient descent optimizer. Use a learning rate of 0.001. Run your function for training and evaluation for 10,000 training steps. At the end of it, show the trained model parameters. Compare the final loss to your baseline loss.\n",
    "7. Plot the test set predictions over the test set ground truth, and additionally compute the loss and the Pearson correlation (see `sklearn` cell).\n",
    "8. Do not feed the entire training set for every iteration (gradient descent), but rather a random subset of 32 training examples (this is called a `batch` and the optimization process `stochastic` gradient descent). Use the given function template and implement its body. Run the function for the same number of iterations and with the same learning rate. Show its loss and plot the predictions. Compare with your baseline and full-batch gradient descent. `Hint:` Implement without replacement, i.e., each sample is taken only once. In order to train a model from scratch, you need to re-instantiate it and wrap it in a new optimizer.\n",
    "9. Benchmark full-batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent for a set of different learning rates ($[.1, .01, .001, .0001, .00001]$). Use 10k iterations. Print, plot, and compare the losses on the last step for each training algorithm and each learning rate. What do you observe? What does it mean? Find a proper way to present the information in the plots such that your takeaway message is clear!\n",
    "10. Benchmark full-batch gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent for different iterations ($[10, 100, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10000]$). Keep the learning rate fixed to $0.0001$. Print, plot, and compare the loss on the last step for each training algorithm and the different number of iterations. What do you observe? What does it mean? Find a proper way to present the information in the plots such that your takeaway message is clear!\n",
    "11. Fill in the class body to implement SGD without automatic differentiation. Do not use torch.nn.Parameter and instead implement a manual backward call. Fill in the new step function that does not use autograd but calls this custom backward call. The gradients of the two parameters can be computed by using the following formulas: $\\delta w = 2 \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_i (\\hat{y}_i-y_i)$ and $\\delta b = 2 \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\\hat{y}_i-y_i)$, where $N$ is the batch size and $\\hat{y}_i$ the prediction for the $i^{th}$ instance. Test the implementation with the call to training already given. Plot the predictions on the test set and compute the MSELoss and Pearson R.\n",

    "11. Fill in the class body to implement SGD without automatic differentiation. Do not use torch.nn.Parameter and instead implement a manual backward call. Fill in the new step function that does not use autograd but calls this custom backward call. The gradients of the two parameters can be computed by using the following formulas: $\\delta w = 2 \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_i (\\hat{y}_i-y_i)$ and $\\delta b = 2 \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\\hat{y}_i-y_i)$, where $N$ is the batch size and $\\hat{y}_i$ the prediction for the $i^{th}$ instance. Test the implementation with the call to training already given. Plot the predictions on the test set and compute the MSELoss and Pearson R.\n",
